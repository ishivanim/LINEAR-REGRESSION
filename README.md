# Linear Regression: TV Advertising Budget vs Sales

## Overview
This repository contains a simple linear regression model that analyzes the impact of TV advertising budgets on sales. The dataset includes advertising expenditures across multiple media (TV, radio, etc.) and their corresponding sales figures. The focus of this analysis is on the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.

## Dataset
### The dataset consists of:
  1) Advertising budget spent on various media (TV, Radio, Newspaper)
  2) Corresponding sales data
  3) For this project, we have specifically extracted and analyzed the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.

## Implementation

  1) The following steps were carried out in this project:
  2) Data Preprocessing: Loaded the dataset and extracted relevant features.
  3) Model Training: Built a linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising budget.
  4) Visualization: Plotted a regression line to visualize the relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.
  5) Performance Evaluation:
      ### Computed evaluation metrics such as:
          1) R² Score: Measures how well the regression model explains the variance in sales.
          2) Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted sales.

## Results

  1) The model shows the correlation between TV advertising budget and sales.
  2) The R² score and MSE provide insights into the accuracy of the model.
  3) The regression plot visually demonstrates the trend between TV advertising spend and sales.

## Usage
  To run the model:

## Clone the repository
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <repo-folder>

## Run the script (replace with your script name)
    python linear_regression.py

## Dependencies
###  Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## Conclusion:
  This project demonstrates the application of linear regression in analyzing advertising impact. The findings help understand how TV ad budgets influence sales and provide a basis for optimizing marketing expenditures.
